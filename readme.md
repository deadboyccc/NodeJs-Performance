# Node.js Performance Benchmark

This project is a playground to benchmark Node.js , involving various methods to optimize backend performance using clustering, worker threads, caching, and other scaling strategies.

## Features  

- **Clustering**: Utilize multiple CPU cores to handle concurrent requests efficiently.  
- **Worker Threads**: Offload CPU-intensive tasks to worker threads to improve performance.  
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, in-memory caching) to reduce response times and database load.  
- **Scaling Strategies**: Explore horizontal and vertical scaling approaches to optimize application performance.  
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.  
- **Database Optimization**: Apply indexing, query optimization, and connection pooling to enhance database performance.  
- **Event-Driven Microservices**:  
  - Use **RabbitMQ** for reliable message queuing and asynchronous task processing.  
  - Use **Apache Kafka** for high-throughput event streaming and real-time data processing.  
- **Benchmarking & Performance Testing**:  
  - Measure throughput, latency, and resource utilization.  
  - Compare the impact of different scaling strategies and caching mechanisms.  
  - Stress-test message brokers (RabbitMQ, Kafka) to evaluate their performance under high loads.  


## Benchmarking Tools

- **k6**: A modern load testing tool to benchmark the performance.
- **Apache Benchmark (ab)**: A simple tool to test and run benchmarks.

## Monitoring and Visualization

- **PM2**: Use the PM2 npm package to view a beautiful UI showing performance metrics.
- **Grafana**: Visualize performance data with customizable dashboards.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

2. **Run the Application**:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

3. **Run Benchmarks**:
  - Using k6:
    ```bash
    k6 run src/script.js
    ```
  - Using Apache Benchmark:
    ```bash
    ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://localhost:3000/
    ```

4. **Monitor Performance**:
  ```bash
  pm2 monit
  ```

5. **View Grafana Dashboards**:
  - Start Grafana server:
    ```bash
    grafana-server
    ```
  - Open Grafana in your browser and configure dashboards.
